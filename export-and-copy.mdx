### Export Visible Data

**Purpose**: Export the current view (after filtering, sorting, grouping) to CSV, Excel (XLSX), or PDF.

**User Value**: Accountants need to extract data for reports, share with colleagues, or import into other systems.

**Considerations**:

- Export button in toolbar with format dropdown (CSV, XLSX, PDF)
- Export scope options:
  - "All rows (current view)" — all filtered/sorted rows
  - "Selected rows only"
  - "Current page" (if paginated)
  - "All data (unfiltered)" — with warning about size
- Include/exclude options:
  - Group headers and subtotals (when grouped)
  - Column formatting (XLSX can preserve number formats)
  - Hidden columns
- Progress indicator for large exports (>50K rows)
- File name auto-generated: {table-name}_{date}_{filter-summary}.csv


### Copy-Paste Friendly

**Purpose**: Copy selected cells/rows to clipboard in tab-separated format compatible with Excel paste.

**User Value**: Quick copy of a few rows to paste into an email, spreadsheet, or another tool.

**Considerations**:

- Select cells/rows → Ctrl+C copies as TSV (tab-separated values)
- Include column headers as first row of copied data
- Copy formatting: plain text for paste into text editors, rich text for paste into Excel
- Right-click context menu: "Copy selected rows," "Copy column," "Copy cell value"
- Visual flash/toast on copy: "42 rows copied to clipboard"
- Support for Ctrl+A to select all visible rows


### Print-Friendly View

**Purpose**: Generate a print-optimized layout of the current table view.

**User Value**: Physical printouts still common in accounting for signing, filing, and meeting review.

**Considerations**:

- "Print" option opens a print preview in a new window/modal
- Print layout:
  - Repeating column headers on each page
  - Page numbers and table title in header/footer
  - Adjusted column widths to fit page width (or landscape option)
  - Subtotals and group headers preserved
  - Conditional formatting colors adjusted for grayscale printing option
- Page break controls: break after each group, or every N rows
- Option to include/exclude filter summary at top of printout
