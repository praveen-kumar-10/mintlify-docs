title: 'Grouping & Summaries'

### Row Grouping

**Purpose**: Group rows by one or more column values, creating a hierarchical tree structure.

**User Value**: "Group all transactions by Account Type, then by Department" — fundamental for financial review and reporting.

**Considerations**:

- Drag column header to a "group zone" drop area above the table
- Or right-click header → "Group by this column"
- Multi-level grouping (up to 4 levels to prevent performance degradation)
- Group rows show: group value, row count, and aggregate values
- Expand/collapse individual groups; "Expand All / Collapse All" buttons
- Indentation for nested groups (16px per level)
- Group row visually distinct (bold text, subtle background, expand/collapse chevron)
- When grouped, original row numbers shown alongside group-relative indices

### Aggregate / Summary Rows

**Purpose**: Display computed aggregates (sum, average, count, min, max) at group level and table footer.

**User Value**: "What's the total debits for the Expense group?" — eliminates the need to export to Excel for basic summarization.

**Considerations**:

- Per-column aggregate function selector (right-click column header → "Summarize: Sum / Avg / Count / Min / Max / None")
- Aggregates shown in:
  - Group rows (when grouping is active)
  - Sticky footer row (always, for full table)
  - Status bar for selected rows (selection-scoped aggregates)
- Formatted with same column formatting (currency, decimals, etc.)
- Weighted average option for financial calculations
- Aggregate values visually distinguished (bold, slightly different background)

### Subtotal Rows (Inline Subtotals)

**Purpose**: Insert subtotal rows at natural breakpoints (e.g., after each account category) without full grouping.

**User Value**: Mimics traditional accounting report formats (trial balance, income statement) where subtotals appear inline.

**Considerations**:

- "Insert subtotals by [column]" option adds subtotal rows after each distinct value change in a sorted column
- Subtotal row spans the full width, shows aggregates for numeric columns
- Visually styled as a separator row (heavier border, bold text, light background)
- Can be enabled alongside sorting (sort by the subtotal column first, then enable subtotals)
