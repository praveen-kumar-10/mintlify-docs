### View Management (Saved Views)

**Purpose**: Save complete table configurations (columns, sort, filter, grouping, formatting) as named views.

**User Value**: An accountant needs different views for different tasks: "Month-End Close," "Audit Review," "AP Aging Analysis." Reconfiguring the table each time wastes 5-10 minutes.

**Considerations**:

- "Views" dropdown in toolbar showing saved views + "Save current as..."
- Auto-save option: changes to current view save automatically (with undo)
- Default view: system-provided baseline that can't be deleted
- View includes ALL state: column visibility, order, widths, pinning, sort, filters, grouping, formatting, density, column formats
- "Share view" generates a shareable link or saves view for the team
