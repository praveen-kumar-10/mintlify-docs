### "Go to Row" Jump Control

**Purpose**: Instantly navigate to a specific row by number or primary key (e.g., Transaction ID, Journal Entry #).

**User Value**: Accountants frequently reference specific line items during audits or reconciliation. Scrolling through 500K+ rows is infeasible.

**Considerations**:

- Input field in TableToolbar with typeahead supporting both row index and business key lookup
- Show row context preview (surrounding 2–3 rows) before jumping so users confirm they're targeting the right record
- Support range input (e.g., "1500-1520") to jump and auto-select a range
- Animate scroll to destination (brief 150ms ease) so users perceive spatial movement, but offer "instant jump" in preferences for power users
- Maintain focus on the target row after jump for keyboard continuity

### Quick Row Search (Find-in-Table)

**Purpose**: Ctrl+F-style search across all visible columns to locate rows matching a text query.

**User Value**: Analysts searching for a vendor name, memo text, or specific dollar amount across the entire table without knowing which column contains the data.

**Considerations**:

- Floating search bar (like browser find) with match count ("3 of 147 matches"), prev/next navigation
- Highlight matching cells with background color (yellow) and scroll to first match
- Option to "filter to matches only" (narrows the table) vs. "highlight only" (keeps all rows visible)
- Search should work across formatted display values (e.g., "\$1,234.56" matches "1234")
- Escape dismisses, but last search term persists in session

### Minimap / Scroll Position Indicator

**Purpose**: Visual overview of position within the dataset, similar to code editor minimaps.

**User Value**: In 100K+ row tables, the scrollbar thumb becomes tiny and imprecise. A minimap provides spatial context showing where bookmarks, highlighted rows, and search matches exist relative to current viewport.

**Considerations**:

- Narrow vertical strip (12px wide) alongside the scrollbar
- Color-coded markers: bookmarks (blue dots), search matches (yellow), grouped section boundaries (gray lines), current selection (green)
- Click on minimap to jump to that position
- Can be hidden for minimal UI preference
