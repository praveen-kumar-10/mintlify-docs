title: 'Sorting & Filtering'

### Multi-Column Sorting

**Purpose**: Sort data by multiple columns in priority order.

**User Value**: "Sort by Account Type ascending, then by Date descending, then by Amount descending" — essential for financial data analysis.

**Considerations**:

- Click column header = single-column sort (toggles asc → desc → none)
- Shift+Click = add column to multi-sort stack
- Sort priority numbers displayed in header (①, ②, ③)
- Sort indicator arrows (▲▼) in headers
- "Clear all sorts" button in toolbar when any sort is active
- Sort configuration also available in dedicated sort panel (for keyboard users and complex sorts)
- Stable sort guarantee: rows with equal values maintain their original relative order

### Column-Specific Filtering

**Purpose**: Filter rows based on column values with type-appropriate filter controls.

**User Value**: "Show me only Expense accounts with amounts \> \$10,000 in Q3 2024" — complex filtering is daily work for analysts.

**Considerations**:

- Filter icon in each column header; clicking opens a filter popover anchored to that column
- Filter type adapts to column data type:
  - **Text**: contains / equals / starts with / regex + quick-select checklist of unique values
  - **Numeric/Currency**: equals / greater than / less than / between / top N / bottom N
  - **Date**: exact date / date range picker / relative (last 30 days, this quarter, YTD)
  - **Enum/Category**: multi-select checklist with search
- Active filters shown as dismissible chips in toolbar: [Account Type: Expense ×] [Amount: \> \$10K ×]
- Compound filters: AND within same column, AND/OR between columns (advanced mode)
- Filter count badge on column header when active

### Saved Filter Presets

**Purpose**: Save and recall named filter configurations.

**User Value**: Accountants run the same analyses repeatedly (month-end review, audit prep, reconciliation). Rebuilding complex filters each time is wasteful.

**Considerations**:

- "Save current filters as..." option → name input dialog
- Dropdown of saved presets in filter area
- Edit/rename/delete saved presets
- Share presets with team members (if collaboration features exist)
- System presets for common accounting scenarios (e.g., "Unreconciled Items," "High-Value Transactions")

### Quick Column Filters (Inline Header Filters)

**Purpose**: Persistent filter row directly below the header for rapid, always-visible filtering.

**User Value**: Power users (most accountants) prefer an always-visible filter row rather than opening popovers — similar to Excel's filter row.

**Considerations**:

- Optional secondary header row with compact filter inputs per column
- Toggled on/off via toolbar button ("Show filter row")
- Text columns: simple text input with implicit "contains"
- Numeric: comparison operator dropdown + number input
- Date: compact date range picker
- Must not interfere with column resize or sort click targets
