title: 'Column Sizing & Scrolling'

### Column Resizing

**Purpose**: Manually adjust column widths by dragging header borders.

**User Value**: Auto-sized columns can't anticipate every user's needs — some want a wider "Description" column, others want it narrow because they never read it.

**Considerations**:

- Resize handle on right edge of each column header (visible on hover, 6px grab zone)
- Double-click resize handle = auto-fit to content (scans visible rows)
- Minimum width: 40px (prevents accidental collapse to 0)
- Maximum width: 800px (prevents runaway expansion)
- Resize cursor (col-resize) as affordance
- Show width tooltip during drag ("240px")
- "Reset all widths" option in Column Settings

### Auto-Fit Modes

**Purpose**: Automatically size columns to content or distribute available width.

**User Value**: Quick way to optimize table layout without manual resizing each column.

**Considerations**:

- Three modes available from Column Settings:
  - Fit to Content: Each column sized to longest visible value (+ header text)
  - Fit to Page: Columns stretch proportionally to fill viewport width (no horizontal scroll)
  - Fixed: All columns use a uniform width (user-specified)
- Per-column override: any column can be manually resized after auto-fit
- "Fit to Content" should sample visible rows + first/last 100 rows (not full dataset — too slow for 1M rows)

### Virtualized Rendering

**Purpose**: Render only visible rows and columns to maintain 60fps performance with massive datasets.

**User Value**: Transparent to users — they simply experience a fast, responsive table regardless of data size.

**Considerations**:

- Scrollbar should accurately represent total dataset size (not just rendered rows)
- No visible pop-in or flickering during fast scrolling
- "Overscan" buffer (render 20 extra rows above/below viewport) to prevent blank flashes
- Consider showing a loading shimmer for extremely fast scroll (scroll velocity \> threshold)
- Row height: fixed preferred for performance; if variable, pre-measure or estimate

### Horizontal Scroll via Keyboard & Shift+Scroll

**Purpose**: Allow horizontal navigation without a horizontal scrollbar click.

**User Value**: Accountants on laptops without mice need efficient horizontal traversal. Horizontal scrollbar is often tiny and hard to target.

**Considerations**:

- Shift+MouseWheel = horizontal scroll (standard UX convention)
- Arrow keys when focused on a cell navigate cell-by-cell (including horizontally)
- Tab/Shift+Tab moves through focusable cells in reading order
- When a cell is focused via keyboard, auto-scroll to bring it into view (both axes)

Optional: bottom horizontal scrollbar made thicker (12px) for easier targeting
